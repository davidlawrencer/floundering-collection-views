## The Task

A `UICollectionView` is a subclass of `UIScrollView` that contains in it `UICollectionViewCells`.

In this repo you will find network helpers, models and API clients that relate to a set of periodic table information. Populate a `UICollectionView` with information from these models in this repo. The `UICollectionView` should flow up and down, with two columns of cells side by side.

Each `UICollectionViewCell` should have:
- the large image for the element that is the size of the entire cell
- the name of the element
- the atomic mass of the element

Try to lay out these cells in a similar format to what one sees when looking at the periodic table.
